Description: Binding models which are useful when analysing protein-ligand interactions by techniques such as Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) or Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). Naman B. Shah, Thomas M. Duncan (2014) <doi:10.3791/51383>. Hoang H. Nguyen et al. (2015) <doi:10.3390/s150510481>. After initial binding parameters are known, binding curves can be simulated and parameters can be varied. The models within this package may also be used to fit a curve to measured binding data using non-linear regression.
