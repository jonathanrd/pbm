Title: Protein Binding Models

Description: Binding models which are useful when analysing protein-ligand interactions by techniques such as Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) or Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). After initial binding parameters are known, binding curves can be simulated and parameters can be varied. The models within this package may also be used to fit a curve to measured binding data using non-linear regression.
